# Pairwise Conditional Random Field

Implemented with [PyStruct](https://pystruct.github.io/index.html)

## Prerequisite
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. [pystruct](https://pystruct.github.io/installation.html)
(note that pystruct is only supported on Python2, Python3.6 or less,
we use Python2.7 to test the code)
4. The model requires `af_py2.pickle` which stores the author feature matrix with 
pickle protocol 2 (since we use Python2). We provide the pickle file in the directory.
To re-generate the pickle file, run `gen_author_feature_py2_pickle.py`.

## Train and Evaluate
`python crf.py`


## Experiment Results
We have run the model with `python crf.py > crf.log`, 
you can either rerun the model or directly check our results in `crf.log`
